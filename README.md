# Tic Tac Toe
## A Python tic tac toe game

To start the game, run `python3 main.py`

First, you have to select the game level. Today, it has three levels

In all the tests I've done at bot level three, the results have always been either draws or wins for the bot. So, if my tests are correct, the bot will never lose at level three...

To play, you have to look to your numeric keyboard (it's similar to the tic tac toe's game board), and type the number of the move that you want to do

You are always the "O" and the bot "X", but the bot will always make a draw to see who starts at the beginning of each match

Above I put an image to consult the houses of the game, in case of you don't have a numeric keyboard available

Have Fun!
